# AirBnB_clone



## Description of the project
In this Holberton Project, we are starting with the first of several steps, the goal of the project is to develop a simplified clone of the well-known [AirBnB web application](https://www.airbnb.com/). This is a project to sum up  high-level-programming concepts
As it is a simplified clone, it will not have all the features that the original one has, however, it does have the main features.
