# AirBnB_clone

## Description of the project
In this Holberton Project, we are starting with the first of several steps, the goal of the project is to develop a simplified clone of the well-known [AirBnB web application](https://www.airbnb.com/). This is a project to sum up  high-level-programming concepts
As it is a simplified clone, it will not have all the features that the original one has, however, it does have the main features.

## Description of the command interpreter
Basically what the command interpreter does is:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

The objects which are usable with the commands are:
- BaseModel
- User
- Place
- Amenity
- City
- State
